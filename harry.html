class="css-1x4bywk">It is the summer holidays and soon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Harry Potter</a> will be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is counting down the days; there are new spells to be learnt, more Quidditch to be played and the Hogwarts castle to continue exploring. But Harry needs to be careful – there are unexpected dangers lurking…</p><p class="css-1x4bywk">I absolutely love the Harry Potter books and out of the seven I'd probably say that The Goblet of Fire is my favourite, and this is mostly down to the creatures and other wizarding students we meet in the novel. As a lover of Hogwarts it's interesting to know what other wizarding schools are like in the world of Harry Potter, and to explore further the seemingly endless list of creatures. </p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-1x4bywk">I can never find a boring or uninteresting moment in The Goblet of Fire and I never get sick of reading it again and again as it's so easy to lose myself in Harry Potter with the astounding events and distinctive characters. I really like how Hermione Granger strives through in this book as not just a clever girl, but as a girl with passion and determination. I like her complex personality; normally she is typecasted into just being 'intelligent', but Hermione is shown with a more girly and emotive side in this book, giving her more depth than just being Harry's clever friend. She is well-rounded and is more accessible as a regular person (though a witch) with feelings and a personality.</p><p class="css-1x4bywk">In this book we regularly come across Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff, who allows us to see the Hufflepuff house in more depth rather than just briefly touching upon it as it has been in other books. I like how we can see the fairness Cedric strives to uphold throughout this book, showing us the value of Hufflepuffs.</p><p class="css-1x4bywk">Anyone who hasn't read up to The Goblet of Fire should definitely re-think that decision as this is the book where it all changes and it's then impossible to not continue reading the rest of the books. </p><p class="css-1x4bywk">The Goblet of Fire definitely deserves a 10/10 in my opinion.</p><p class="css-1x4bywk"><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books" data-link-name="in body link">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p></div></div><div id="slot-body-end"><div class="css-138pfvh"><section class="css-f9il16"><h2 class="css-1xg62vk"><span> </span></h2><p class="css-127xirx"><span>... as you join us today from India, we have a small favour to ask.
